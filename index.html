      <h2 class="parrafo">Elden Ring</h2>

      <p class="parrafo">Elden Ring is a 2022 action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. It was directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki with worldbuilding provided by fantasy writer George R. R. Martin. It was released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on February 25 by FromSoftware in Japan and Bandai Namco Entertainment internationally. Players control a customizable player character who is on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord.

        Elden Ring is presented through a third-person perspective; players freely roam its interactive open world. The six main areas are traversed using the player character's steed Torrent as the primary mode of travel. Linear, hidden dungeons can be explored to find useful items. Players can use several types of weapons and magic spells, including non-direct engagement enabled by stealth mechanics. Throughout the game's world, checkpoints enable fast travel and allow players to improve their attributes using an in-game currency called Runes. Elden Ring has an online multiplayer mode in which players can join each other for cooperative and player-versus-player combat.
        
        During planning, FromSoftware wanted to create an open-world game with gameplay similar to Dark Souls; the company wanted Elden Ring to act as an evolution of the self-titled debut of the series. Miyazaki admired the work of Martin, whose contributions he hoped would produce a more accessible narrative than those of the company's earlier games. Martin was given unrestricted freedom to design the backstory while Miyazaki was lead writer for the in-game narrative. The developers concentrated on environmental scale, roleplaying, and the story; the scale required the construction of several structures inside the open world.
        
        Elden Ring received critical acclaim for its open-world, gameplay systems, and setting, with some criticism for its technical performance. It won multiple Game of the Year awards and sold over 20 million copies in a year. An expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, was announced in February 2023.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Elden Ring is a third-person perspective, action, role-playing game with a focus on combat and exploration. It includes elements that are similar to those in other FromSoftware-developed games such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The game is set in an open world; players can freely explore the Lands Between and its six main areas, which include Limgrave—an area of grassy plains and ancient ruins—and Caelid, a wasteland that is home to undead monsters. Open-world areas are explored using the character's mount Torrent as the main mode of travel; players can also use fast travel outside combat. Throughout the game, players encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies, including demigods who rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses. Elden Ring also includes hidden dungeons, catacombs, tunnels, and caves where players can fight bosses and gather helpful items.</p>
